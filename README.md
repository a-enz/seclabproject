## Vagrant cheat sheet
- Official documentation page: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/index.html
- *vagrant up*: creates, configures and starts all guest machines in the vagrant file
- *vagrant up* [name|id]: creates, configures and starts only speficied guest machines from the vagrant file
- *vagrant halt*: TODO
- *vagrant halt [name|id]*: TODO
- *vagrant ssh [name|id]*: TODO
- *vagrant suspend [name|id]*: TODO
- *vagrant resume [name|id]*: TODO
- *vagrant destroy*: TODO
- *vagrant destroy [name|id]*: TODO
- *vagrant reload [name|id]*: TODO


## How to work with the environment
Creating each time the whole environment is costly in terms of time and resources, so to develop and test
I would advise to use *halt/up* (stop/start VM) and *suspend/resume* (hybernate/resume VM).
