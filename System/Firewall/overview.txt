INTERFACES
-------------------------------
Consists of 3 interfaces: 
- I0: connects to internet
- I1: connects to DMZ (webserver)
- I2: connects to internal network


[INET] internet ----- I0 [FW] I2 ---- [INTERNAL]
		                  I1		{backup, core ca}
		                   |
		                   |
		                 [DMZ]
		                web_server

-------------------------------
ROUTING REQ.
-------------------------------
IO:
==
- FWD http and https traffic to web server at I1
- FWD admin traffic (ssh traffic ?) to correct machine at I1 or I2
- DROP everything else
I1:
==
- FWD response to client
- FWD requests to core ca
- FWD response to admin (ssh traffic ?)
- FWD backup traffic
- DROP everyting else
I2:
==
- FWD core ca response to web server
- FWD backup request to web server
- FWD response to admin (ssh traffic ?)
- DROP everything else ?


-------------------------------
PFSENSE SETUP
-------------------------------
install
=======
- Download 64 bit pfSense .iso file
- on VirtualBox create 64bit FreeBSD machine 'F'
- in VB settings of 'F' go to Storage and add the .iso
  as an optical drive
- start 'F' and go through standard install of pfsense
- Reboot 'F' after removing .iso file

add network adapters
====================
Need 3 interfaces (see Figure above) in VirtualBox Settings of 'F'
- Adapter1: internet access (bridged interface) [INET]
- Adapter2: internal network [DMZ]
- Adapter3: internal network [INTERNAL]

By choosing 'host-only adapter' instead of 'internal
network' you can move your host machine into the same 
subnet. Basically an 'internal network' with your machine 
added. But you might have to adjust the adapter and 
network mask for the specific 'host-only adapter' of 
VirtualBox: File > Preferences > Network. The adapter IP 
and network mask need to be such that the IP of the 
pfsense interface chosen below (em1 or em2) is in range.
e.g. would be valid for em1 at 192.168.50.50./24
IPv4 :192.168.50.1
mask: 255.255.255.0

assign network interfaces
=========================
In the pfsense console:
- assign interfaces (option 1)
  em0(Adapter1) -> WAN
  em1(Adapter2) -> LAN (renamed INTERNAL)
  em2(Adapter3) -> OPT1 (renamed DMZ)
- set interface IP addresses (option 2)
  em0: DHCP (not static)
  em1: 192.168.50.50/24
  em2: 192.168.51.51/24


work in web dashboard
==================
The web dashboard is by default at the LAN interface, 
check that the machine connecting to the web dashboard is 
in the same network.
- to save the firewall config: store config.xml which can
  be obtained from e.g. Diagnostics > Backup & Restore in
  the web dashboard
- Check restrictions on WAN interface: uncheck option on
  'Reserved Networks' (private networks, bogon networks)
  Otherwise host machine might be blocked (b/c we're 
  working in virtual environment i guess?)
