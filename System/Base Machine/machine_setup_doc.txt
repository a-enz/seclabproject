Users
=====
# all this needs to be done as root
# and generally needs user input

# remove unwanted users
userdel <user>
userdel centos
rm -rf /home/<user>
rm -rf /home/centos

# create new user and add to existing groups,
# i.e a group with correct sudoers rights
# (alternatively modify sudo config with 'visudo')
useradd <user> -G <list of groups>
useradd iadmin -G wheel # 'wheel' is sudoer with all rights

passwd <user>
passwd iadmin


Software
========

basic_provisioning.sh


Static IP 
=========
# (that persists after shutdown)
# I wrote my own config for 'ifcfg-enp0s3' and replaced the old one 
# (which can be found in 'ifcfg-enp0s3.bk')

Hardening
=========
# Run script hardening.sh
hardening.sh


Local Firewall
==============
# The image had some iptable rules already installed
# for now those seem to be ok and they remain as-is.
