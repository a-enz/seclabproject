userdel <user>
userdel centos
rm -rf /home/<user>
rm -rf /home/centos

# create new user and add to existing groups,
# i.e a group with correct sudoers rights
# (alternatively modify sudo config with 'visudo')
useradd <user> -G <list of groups>
useradd iadmin -G wheel # 'wheel' is sudoer with all rights
# add/change password of user
passwd <user>
passwd iadmin
