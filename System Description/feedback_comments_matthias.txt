======================================================================

General:
- Your report is very incomplete. Time to speed up now.
- Please do follow the template, and do not drop (sub-)sections in the final version.
- Justify your decisions! Preferably by using the security principles from the book. So far you have only listed how you are doing it, not why.
- Check for grammar in final version.

System Characterization/Overview:
- Consider separating the webserver from the firewall; where to put webserver machine then?
	Separating might be a good idea in the spirit of compartmentalization, but on the other
	hand it kind of reduces simplicity and usability. The webserver was a single entry point before, so that is
	not really an argument, but we could say that the firewall machine is easy to replace?
- Maybe further separation of internal network on general principle?
	We could have a separate database machine, which has basically the same pros and cons as the separate
	firewall. Additionally, we could argue that it's less of a single point of failure, at least in the situation where 
	the cert. manager goes down, then we the database is still reachable, so at least authentication stays up.
- Main CA signing key+certificate, where is it, how is it secured, what happens if lost, many questions open!
	Not really sure here, but I guess the Main signing key must be on the machine with the cert. manager as it is needed
	to sign new certificates which are requested in real time. As to how it is secured, the machine should be secured, but
	on the machine itself it has to be somehow accessible as we already kind of discussed.

System Functionality:
- You need a section talking about functionality as described in the template!
- What about revocation?
- What about CA admin interface?
- In general, you only described the components, not explicitly the required functionality.


Security Design/Components:
- You need a section talking about security design as such as described in the template!
- Don't forget to provide a client machine outside of internal network (in your set of VMs and description).
- Nothing is said about security of data, either in transit or at rest.
- Authentication? Sessions? Key management?
- "Certification Generator" - do you mean private/public key pair generation, creating a certificate from the public key, and a pkcs#12 archive with the certificate and private key for the user to download?


Backup:
- Frequency of backups? Incremental/full? What about newly created certificates?


Assets:
- List of assets ok, but no properties given! Also note that for an asset to be here means that it should also be evaluated in the risk analysis!


Risk Analysis:
- Very short, I expect a lot more risks.
- Please use running numbers for the risk evaluation: 1,2,3,4,5,6 instead of 1,2, 1, 1,2 for much easier reference
- Script kiddies as high impact? Probably not; what other high risk scenarion can you think of?
- Required: risk acceptance for high (and medium) risk cases.


minor:
Bibliography: Your references are jumbled together, [1] should be CSPP, [2] should be the AppInfSec book, but the two are mixed to 1 entry
